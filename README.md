# README Generator

## Description

This project is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. The user will be asked a series of questions and be able to enter information relevant to each section of the README.md file, and that information will be dynamically inserted into the template upon output of the README.md file

## Usage

Once the user runs the application using the "node index.js" command, a series of questions will appear in the terminal, one at a time, and ask the user to enter information that will be used to populate the README.md template. This will include a project title and description, usage instructions, installation instructions, credits, contribution guidelines and testing instructions. The user will also be given a choice of four licenses that they can select from. If they wish to not use a license, that will be an option. In this case no license information will be displayed in the template. If a license is selected, then a badge for that license will appear in the description section, and the license section will be added to the template. The user will also be asked to enter their GitHub username and email address. These will be inserted as links in the questions section for the user.
